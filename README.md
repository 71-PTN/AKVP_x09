# AKVP x09, a 9-bit processor
My take on HCMUT's Department of Electronics' 9-bit processor.

Yes, you read it right. NINE bits, not EIGHT. I'm just doing what I was required to do.

This project is made in IntelÂ® Quartus Prime Lite Edition, for DE10-Standard. It is possible, however, to modify the codes to fit any board you want.

Here are the requirements. All credit goes to Department of Electronics, Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.

Added a display register for outputting to three 7-segment displays, 3 bits each. It is obvious that base-8 or octal, must be used.

# The debugger, a.k.a. the visualizer

Files in [debugger](debugger/) have the exact same files as the root folder, plus some extra components to aid in outputting all register contents, RAM contents, and control signals to [DE10-Standard](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=1081)'s GPIOs. Since there are only 36 GPIO pins while the total number of outputs is 162 (13 x 9-bit registers + 29 control signals + 7 RAM address bits + 9 RAM content bits), I have to put together some external components to do the trick.

First off, the register contents. I soldered 117 LEDs into a 9 x 13 matrix, with 9 anodes each column connected, and 13 cathodes each row connected. An [inverted ring counter](debugger/ring_counter.vhd) loops through one row at time at super high speed, while the *when else* block at the end of the [top-level entity](debugger/debugger.vhd) determines which register will be outputted to the columns of each row.

Outputting control signals and RAM stuff is slightly more complicated. The [parallel-to-serial converter](debugger/PISO.vhd) utilizes DE10-Standard's internal 50 MHz clock to continuously generate three lines of serial data: data input, shift clock, and output clock, which will then feed into respective inputs of one [74HC595](https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT595.pdf) IC, which is chained together with more 74HC595's to output the serial data back to parallel, forming a 3-to-29 converter for control signals, and 3-to-16 for RAM.
