My take on HCMUT's Department of Electronics' 9-bit processor.

Yes, you read it right. NINE bits, not EIGHT. I'm just doing what I was required to do.

This project is made in IntelÂ® Quartus Prime Lite Edition, for DE10-Standard. It is possible, however, to modify the codes to fit any board you want.

Here are the requirements. All credit goes to Department of Electronics, Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.

Added a display register for outputting to three 7-segment displays, 3 bits each. It is obvious that base-8 or octal, must be used.
